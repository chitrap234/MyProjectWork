Test Plan

scope of testing : we are Testing response of Order API which is interface communicator between company’s 
Enterprise Sales and Financial systems. we need to check if data is properly created in Server.

HTTP POST : We are validating Positive response[200] and negative response[400]. For positive case we are passing all
valid data input while to check negative response I have passed incorrect data.

Tools used : 
java [programming Language]
maven [Build automation Tool]
TestNg [Unit Testing Framework]
RestAssured [Library  to test RestFul API]

Testing Approach: 
We can use data driven testing as passing Data from DataProvider Or Excel File. Another approach could be
store data in HashMap collection.

Test environment : Here host URL is not provided so  used of LocalHost to run Tests with end point /order
https://localhost:8080/order

Deliverable: 
HTTP Post: with 200 response code
HTTP Post :with 400 response code

Advance Approach
1)In our Framework we can create one file to store only Host URI
2)We can have separate java class to store all EndPoint as a Static String.
3)Allure Reports can be integrated in framework
4)Logs can be generated for each test cases.
Testng suits can be created to run 

Version Control GitHub is used to store framework.
